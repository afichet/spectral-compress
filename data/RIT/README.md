# RIT Fluorescent Database

This database comes from Rochester Institute of Technology.

The database is made up of sampling different printing processes under normal reproduction conditions of solid colors and a variety of fluorescent materials. Throughout the experiment a bispectral spectrophotometer (BFC-450) manufactured by Labsphere was used to measure the samples.

All the data files were downloaded from https://www.rit.edu/cos/colorscience/re_sgonzalez.php
